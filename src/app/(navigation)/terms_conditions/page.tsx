        GDPR Compliance Addendum / Considerations for Citadel-i-Projects
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-2">
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 9, 2026
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Citadel-i-Projects is based in Nigeria and primarily serves users in
        Nigeria and other regions. However, the General Data Protection
        Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) may apply to our processing
        of personal data if we offer educational services (tutoring, exam
        preparation, and counseling) to individuals located in the European
        Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA), even if we have no
        physical establishment in the EU.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This addendum outlines key GDPR compliance considerations and
        supplements our main Privacy Policy. If GDPR applies to your data, you
        benefit from its protections in addition to the rights described in our
        Privacy Policy and under applicable local law (such as the Nigeria Data
        Protection Act).
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        When Does GDPR Apply to Citadel-i-Projects?
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-2">
        GDPR has extraterritorial effect (Article 3(2)). It applies to our
        processing of personal data of individuals in the EU/EEA when we:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          Offer goods or services to them (even free services like registration
          for tutoring sessions, counseling, or exam resources), or
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor their behavior (e.g., through cookies, analytics, or usage
          tracking on our Website).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-2">Indicators that may trigger GDPR include:</p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Website accessible in EU countries without geo-blocking</li>
        <li>
          Content or marketing targeted at EU users (e.g., references to EU
          exams, currencies, languages)
        </li>
        <li>
          Accepting registrations/payments from EU-based students or teachers
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        If you are located in the EU/EEA and use our services, GDPR likely
        applies to your data. We do not specifically target the EU market, but
        we do not block EU access either. We therefore take a cautious approach
        and provide GDPR-aligned information.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        Key GDPR Principles We Follow
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-2">
        We adhere to the core GDPR principles (Article 5):
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency — We process data on lawful
          bases only.
        </li>
        <li>
          Purpose limitation — Data is collected for specific, explicit
          purposes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Accuracy — We take reasonable steps to keep data accurate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Storage limitation — Data is kept no longer than necessary.
        </li>
        <li>

          place.
        </li>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        Lawful Bases for Processing (Article 6)
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-2">
        We rely on the following lawful bases depending on the context:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          Contract — To provide tutoring, exam preparation, counseling, and
          account services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consent — For certain marketing communications, optional features, or
          non-essential cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legitimate interests — For security, fraud prevention, service
          improvement, and analytics (balanced against your rights).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        For special categories of data (e.g., health data related to
        educational accommodations), we rely on explicit consent or other
        permitted bases under Article 9.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">

          Whether data is transferred internationally and safeguards used.
        </li>
        <li>

          currently use significant automated decision-making with legal
          effects).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">

      </h2>

      <p className="mb-2">
        If GDPR applies, you have the following rights (subject to legal
        exceptions):
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        International Data Transfers (Chapter V)
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        As we operate from Nigeria (no EU adequacy decision currently in place
        for Nigeria), any transfer of EU/EEA personal data outside the EEA
        requires safeguards. We use:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>
          Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European
          Commission, or
        </li>
        <li>
          Other appropriate safeguards permitted under Articles 46–49.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We do not transfer data to countries without adequate protection unless
        safeguards or derogations apply.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        Children’s Data (Article 8)
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        For information society services, consent for children under 16
        requires verifiable parental consent (some EU countries allow 13+). We
        take extra care with users under 18, requiring parental/guardian
        involvement where appropriate.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        Data Protection by Design &amp; Default (Article 25)
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We implement privacy-friendly measures from the start (e.g., data
        minimization, pseudonymization where possible, strong security
        defaults).
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        Data Processors (Article 28)
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We use processors (e.g., cloud hosting, payment providers) bound by
        GDPR-compliant agreements.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
